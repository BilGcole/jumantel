						may, at our own discretion, either contact you for instructions
						or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p>

						whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit/debit
						card charged. In the event that we are unable to provide the
						services, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. A full
						refund will be given where you have already paid for the
